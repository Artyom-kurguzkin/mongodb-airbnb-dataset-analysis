# Overview 

This project aimed to investigate sample airbnb dataset available at mongodb.com 

We looked for the most significant predictor for a listing to receive a high score review. 

We found that the dataset was consistently biased towards high score reviews.

The review score was a complex metric made up of multiple variables (location, host friendliness, etc.). We compared correlation coefficients among these variables and the final score ratings to distinguish the most significant factor. 

We concluded that the cleanliness of the listing was the most significant predictor of its score review.
